# Notice: We unpaused the development, but it will be dramatically slow.

We actually are students and our spare time is going to a dead end. Thus, we expect to work on sarchile every Sunday. But you still can use sarchile since it's very stable to use.

# sarchile

**S**imple **Arch** Linux on mob**ile**

## Introduction

This (project, maybe?) is a set of quick and simple scripts to help you run Arch Linux on your Android. And yea, we use Termux with proot.

## Information

We have moved all information of sarchile project to its [wiki](https://github.com/Weeb-Linux/sarchile/wiki).

## Announcements

We won't use any social network (like Twitter) to post news about sarchile.

We currently are using [Discussions](https://github.com/Weeb-Linux/sarchile/discussions) for this purpose.

## Bug and feature tracker

Please see [sarchile development board](https://github.com/Weeb-Linux/sarchile/projects/1).

## Image building

Beside making scripts for user interaction, we also have pushed a lot of efforts to base image building script to ensure the best quality for sarchile.

Simply checkout `base-image` branch. It uses GitHub Actions to build images automatically.

We do know this is a bad practice for a software repository but we don't have much time to think about it yet.
