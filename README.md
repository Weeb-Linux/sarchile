**S**imple **Arch** Linux on mob**ile**

## Introduction

This (project, maybe?) is a set of quick and simple scripts to help you run Arch Linux on your Android. And yea, we use Termux with proot.

## Information

We have moved all information of sarchile project to its [wiki](https://github.com/Weeb-Linux/sarchile/wiki).

## Bug and feature tracker

Please see [sarchile development board](https://github.com/Weeb-Linux/sarchile/projects/1).

## Image building

Beside making scripts for user interaction, we also have pushed a lot of efforts to base image building script to ensure the best quality for sarchile.

Simply checkout `base-image` branch. It uses GitHub Actions to build images automatically.

We do know this is a bad practice for a software repository but we don't have much time to think about it yet.
